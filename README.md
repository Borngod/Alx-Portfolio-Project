# Project Documentation: Feature-Rich Calculator

## Introduction

This documentation provides an overview and detailed information about the feature-rich calculator project. The task was to create a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with additional features for enhanced functionality and user experience.

## Features

### 1. Basic Calculator Functionality

The calculator supports essential arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic calculations.

### 2. History Tracker

The history tracker keeps a record of previous calculations, allowing users to review and reuse them. This feature enhances the calculator's usability by providing a quick reference to past results.

### 3. Input from Keypress and Touch

The calculator is designed to accept input not only from traditional mouse clicks but also from keypress events and touch gestures. This ensures a seamless user experience across various devices and input methods.

### 4. Input Validator

To maintain data integrity and prevent errors, the calculator includes an input validator. It validates user input to ensure that only valid characters and sequences are accepted, minimizing the risk of incorrect calculations.

### 5. Stylish Thousand Separator

For improved readability of large numbers, the calculator incorporates a stylish thousand separator. This feature visually separates digits into groups of three, making it easier for users to read and understand numeric input and output.

## Technologies Used

The project leverages the following technologies:

- **HTML:** Provides the structure for the calculator interface.
- **CSS:** Defines the styles and layout of the calculator for a visually appealing user interface.
- **JavaScript:** Implements the calculator's functionality, including arithmetic operations, history tracking, input validation, and event handling.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Basic Calculations:**
   - Click on the calculator buttons to input numbers and perform basic calculations.
   - Alternatively, use the keyboard for input, and press Enter to calculate the result.

2. **History Tracker:**
   - View the history of calculations on the display area.
   - Click on a previous result to reuse it in the current calculation.

3. **Touch Support:**
   - The calculator is responsive to touch gestures, making it accessible on touchscreen devices.

4. **Input Validation:**
   - Invalid input is visually indicated, and the calculator prevents the execution of calculations until valid input is provided.

5. **Thousand Separator:**
   - Large numbers are formatted with a stylish thousand separator for better readability.

## Conclusion

The feature-rich calculator project successfully enhances the basic calculator functionality with additional features for improved usability and aesthetics. Users can perform calculations easily, track their history, and enjoy a visually pleasing interface. The project demonstrates the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and feature-packed calculator tool.
